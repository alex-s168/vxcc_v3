# VXCC
optimizing, small, simple, compiler backend.

VXCC uses SSA IR with block arguments instead of the commonly used phi-nodes.

## compilation stages
- frontend generates non-SSA IR
- backend converts it to SSA
- backend applies optimizations
- backend converts it to "LL IR" (non-SSA + labels) and performs some more optimizations
- simple code generation

## goals
- easily modifyable and readable code
- not much special knowladge required
- easy to implement code generation for any architecture
- make it easy for people to learn about compiler backends
- good-ish optimizations
- beat QBE

## **non**-goals
- reach complexity of GCC or even LLVM
- beat GCC or LLVM

## frontends
- [C3](https://c3-lang.org/) compiler [fork](https://github.com/alex-s168/c3c)

## building
use the `./build.sh build`

## compile dependencies 
`clang`, `gcc`, or `tcc`: automatically detected. different C compiler can be used by doing `CC=someothercc ./build.sh [build|test]` (`test` can be executed after `build` to run all tests)

`python3`: it is recommended to create a venv in the repository root using `python -m venv venv`

## including into projects
Link with all files returned by `./build.sh libfiles` (at time of writing, only `build/lib.a`)

## using VXCC in a compiler
this is meant to be extremely easy to do (for the frontend developer)

There is some documentation in `frontend_dev_doc.md`.
You can also uselook at the [C3C fork](https://github.com/alex-s168/c3c) in the `src/compiler/vxcc_*` files.

If you have any questions, you can ask me on Discord (`alex_s168`) or send me an [E-Mail](mailto:alexandernutz68@gmail.com)

## contributing
all contributions are welcome! Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.

please do not currently change anything related to:
- codegen system / isel & regalloc (because I want to re-do it in a specific way)
- assembler (^^^)

## current optimizations
- variable inlining
- duplicate code removal
- cmoves
- tailcall
- simplify loops and ifs
- simple pattern replacement of bit extract and similar
- compile time constant eval

## code-gen example
input:
```c
fn void strcpy(char* dest, char* src) @export 
{
    for (usz i = 0; src[i] != '\0'; i ++)
        dest[i] = src[i];
}
```
output:
```asm
strcpy:
  xor r11d, r11d
  .l0:
  mov r9b, byte [rsi + 1 * r11]
  test r9b, r9b
  je .l1
  mov byte [rdi + 1 * r11], r9b
  lea r8, [r11 + 1]
  mov r11, r8
  jmp .l0
  .l1:
  ret
```
This will improve in the close future.

## adding a target 
You need to complete these tasks (in any order):
- add your target to every place with the comment `// add target`.
  (you can use `git grep -Fn "// add target"` to find them)
- write a code generator (see ETC.A or X86 backend as reference) and add the file to the `build.c`
- add support for it to frontends?
